    <button type="button" class="collapsible">What is your idea for perfect?</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>“The condition, state, or quality of being free or as free as possible from all flaws or defects”, “a person or
        thing perceived as the embodiment of perfection”, or “the action or process of improving something until it is
        faultless or as faultless as possible.” The true definition is living a life that you're proud of. That's the
        true meaning of the word perfect.</p>
