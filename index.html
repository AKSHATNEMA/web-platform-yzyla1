          “The condition, state, or quality of being free or as free as possible
          from all flaws or defects”, “a person or thing perceived as the
          embodiment of perfection”, or “the action or process of improving
          something until it is faultless or as faultless as possible.” The true
          definition is living a life that you're proud of. That's the true
          meaning of the word perfect.

          Today for lunch I had hawaiian pizza, which is the best kind of pizza.
          Pineapples are great on anything. Then I made some sweet games on
          Repl.it. What does the future hold for me? Guess we'll find out!
